= Before reading any further =

Before reading any further or trying this plugin on your WordPress platforms and, especially before adding a rating, please **make sure** you have thoroughly studied the [FAQ](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-headers/wiki/FAQ). This plugin might not be what you think it is. Also, this plugin might not be the right plugin for you.

= Notice regarding the functionality of 2.X.X releases =

In Add-Headers releases older than 2.0.0 caching was enabled by default. This resulted in several users, who didn't have the required knowledge about HTTP caching, assuming that the plugin would somehow auto-configure itself according to their web sites' special needs. So, since 2.0.0, no page is allowed to be cached by default and the [configuration](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-headers/wiki/Configuration) of the plugin has become mandatory in order to make the dynamic pages cacheable.

= Official Project Homepage =

The Add-Headers documentation has been moved to the [Add-Headers Development Web Site](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-headers/wiki).

= Changelog Entries =

Please check out the changelog of each release by following the links below. You can also check the [roadmap](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-headers/roadmap "Add-Headers Roadmap") regarding future releases of the plugin.

- 2.0.2
 - Added a global _serial_ option that can be manually incremented to invalidate ETags, i.e. when a sitewide change is made.
- [2.0.1](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/314)
 - This release introduces the concept of setting a different caching timeout on _old_content_. For this reason two new options have been added: [cache_old_content_threshold_seconds](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-headers/wiki/Configuration#cache_old_content_threshold_seconds) and [cache_old_content_max_age_seconds](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-headers/wiki/Configuration#cache_old_content_max_age_seconds). Please see this [configuration example](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-headers/wiki/Configuration#Different-caching-timeout-for-old-content) that demonstrates this functionality.
 - Minor improvements and fixes.
- [2.0.0](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/313)
 - IMPORTANT CHANGE OF THE DEFAULT FUNCTIONALITY: Since the v2.0.0 major release, no page is allowed to be cached by default. Caching needs to be enabled by [configuring](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-headers/wiki/Configuration) the plugin.
 - Improved the header generation mechanism. New header array format: `['HEADER_NAME'] => 'HEADER_VALUE'`
 - Added the `remove_pre_existing_headers` option. When enabled, it instructs the plugin to clear any preexisting ETag, Last-Modified, Expires, Cache-Control and Pragma headers before sending its own headers, according to the user defined options.
 - Other minor fixes and improvements.
- [1.2.1](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/243)
 - Instead of `Pragma: cache`, now sends `Pragma: public`. This is not included in any standard. The `public` value is used by convention.
 - The array that holds the headers just before sending them to the clients now has proper keys for easier header isolation when filtering.
 - Fixed a small bug that happened whenever a taxonomy archive without any posts was visited.
- [1.2.0](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/242)
 - New option added: `cache_max_age_seconds_for_authenticated_users` initially set to 0 seconds. If you need cached content for authenticated users, adjust this accordingly.
 - The `Pragma` header is now also sent with a value of `no-cache` or `cache` according to *Cache-Control* header's `max-age`.
- [1.1.2](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/235)
- [1.1.1](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/217)
 - Bug fix: In 1.1.0 two new filters had been added with wrong prefix in their names. This has been fixed in 1.1.1.
- [1.1.0](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/212)
- [1.0.5](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/211)
- [1.0.4](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/210)
- [1.0.3](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/209)
- [1.0.2](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/208)
- [1.0.1](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/203)
